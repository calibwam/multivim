Multivim is a a vim clone with collaborative real-time editing written in java.

Why multivim?
=============

I would love to have a collaborative real-time terminal based vim for collaborating
on school assignments, but as far as I have found, nothing out there fits the bill.
Originally, the idea was to hack on vim directly. However, vim's code base seems to
be of epic proportions, and changing the paradigm from single user to collaborative
real-time multi user seems to be a monumental task. Therefore, multivim is a complete
rewrite.

My goals for multivim is that it should be:
	- as close to vim as possible in terms of functionality
	- operable in non-gui environments
	- reasonably efficient and stable

Please help me finish it! :)
